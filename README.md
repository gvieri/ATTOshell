# ATTOshell

## ATTO (symbol a) it is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10^-18. So we are speaking of very very tiny shell. 

ATTOshell is a tiny utility for my esp32 development. It has a few of command devoted to SPIFFS file management. The available commands are: 
* ls     (list files)  
* rm     (rm file - no wildcard)
* help   (a simple help message)
* format (the filesystem). 

Some future development cat, and edit. Yep. I'm planning to insert a simple line editor. 

As soon as I need I will introduce fat management on SD card. 

Enjoy and stay tuned.
